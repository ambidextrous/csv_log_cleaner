# CSV Cleaner

## Name

`csv_cleaner` - Clean CSV files to conform to a type schema by streaming them from `stdin` to `stdout` through a small memory buffers using multiple threads and logging data loss.

## Synopsis

```
cat input.csv | csv_cleaner -j schema.json -l log.json > output.csv
```

## Description

The `csv_cleaner` tool takes a JSON CSV schema definition (e.g. one defining a `NAME` column of type String, an `AGE` column of type Int and a `DATE_OF_BIRTH` column of type Date) and a `CSV` file which is required to conform to that definition and cleans the input data to conform with the schema definition.

Illegal values are either cleaned (e.g. by adding `.0` to the end of integer values in a float column) or deleted (e.g. by replacing a `not_a_float` string value in a float column with an empty string), with all data loss being logged in an output JSON file, along with the maximum and minimum illegal values encountered.

Data is processed row-wise, in adjustably sized buffers using all of the available cores for parallel processing. The aim here is to make it possible to process larger-than-memory datasets quickly and efficiently, as part of an extendable Unix pipeline.

### Parameters

`-j` - _required_ path to input JSON schema file
`-l` - _required_ path to output JOSN log file
`-s` - _optional_ (default `','`) separator character, e.g. `'\t'` for TSV files: will be used both in input and output
`-b` - _optional_ buffer size integer (default  `1000`) indicating the size of each new buffer of rows allocated a new thread for processing: if set too low, the costs of thread switching are likely to outweight the benefits of parallel processing. 

## Motivation

The simplicity of the CSV format means that the data such files contain is by its nature un-typed. A valid CSV will give the user no guarantees that the contents of the fields it contains are anything other than strings. This - combined with the fact that CSV files are often generated by error-prone, manual processes - presents a problem when it comes to processing CSV data in ways that require columns to have a particular type. For example, one cannot safely set up a data pipeline to sum the contents of an `AMOUNT_PAID` column when there is no guarantee that it will not contain string values like `"not_a_float"`.

There are multiple existing solutions to this problem, each of which involve their own limitations. 

One solution is what could be lablelled as "Total Permissiveness". This is the default strategy used, for example, by Python's `pandas` dataframe processing library. This approach means that if a single illegal `12.34\n` float value is found in a column, the entire column will read as a string column. This approach keeps the reading logic simple, but means that the processing logic has to be more complex: as you have to write your code with no guarantees that an `AMOUNT_PAID` column will actually contain numerical values.

A second is what could be labelled as "Total Strictness". This is the default strategy used, for example, by the PostgreSQL relational database. This approach means a type schema for the CSV data is used, and that if - for example - a single illegal `12.34\n` float value is found in a column, the entire CSV reading operation will fail. This approach means that it is possible to keep both the writing and processing code simple, but means that reads are often likely to fail when faced with large datasets containing even a tiny proportion of illegal values.

To overcome the limitations of Total Permissiveness and Total Strictness, a third approach is sometimes used, which could be labelled as "Silent Coercion". This approach means a type schema for the CSV data is used, and that if - for example - a single illegal `12.34\n` float value is found in a column, that value will be silently replaced with a NULL value. This approach means that it is possible to keep both the writing and processing code simple, but means insidous data loss can go undetected. For example, this approach could result in an entire `DATE_OF_BIRTH` field being silently replaced with `NULL` values because the dates were formatted as `YYYY-DD-MM` instead of the expected `YYYY-MM-DD` format.

The aim of `csv_cleaner` is to enable data processors to make use of an approach that could be labelled as "Coercion with Logging". In this approach, the user provides a type schema definition for their CSV data and the tool will guarantee that the data piped through the tool will conform that schema (e.g. by removing the illegal trailing `\n` from the end of a `12.34\n` value in a float column, or by deleting entirely a `not_a_valid_float` value from the same column) and logging both the number of deleted values in each column and the maximum and minimum illegal values encountered. This means that users can be confident that their pipeline will not fail due to input type errors either on read or during processing. In addition, any data loss that does take place during the cleaning operation will be logged in a human and computer readable JSON log file - including sample maximum and mimumn illegal values found and illegal value counts and proportions - which can be used to monitor data loss. For example, a monitoring script could be used to ignore data loss in a particular columm if it is below a given threshold value (e.g. 1%) and to raise an alert otherwise.

## Why a CLI tool?

Unix Command Line Interface (CLI) tools have been developed and refined since the 1970s as a simple, fast, memory-efficient, composable way of getting things done.

## Examples

Take the following CSV data from `stdin` 

```
INT_COLUMN,STRING_COLUMN,DATE_COLUMN,ENUM_COLUMN
4,dog,2020-12-31,V1
not_an_int,cat,not_a_date,V2
an_int,weasel,a_date,V5
```

and a JSON CSV schema definition of the form 

```json
{
    "columns": [
        {
            "name": "INT_COLUMN",
            "column_type": "Int"
        },
        {
            "name": "STRING_COLUMN",
            "column_type": "String",
            "nullable": false
        },
        {
            "name": "DATE_COLUMN",
            "column_type": "Date",
            "format": "%Y-%m-%d"
        },
        {
            "name": "ENUM_COLUMN",
            "column_type": "Enum",
            "nullable": false,
            "legal_vals": ["V1", "V2", "V3"],
            "illegal_val_replacement": "V1"
        }
    ]
}
```
as inputs to the command
```csv
input.csv > csv_cleaner -j schema.json -l log_file.json > output.csv 
```
to output the following to the `output.csv` file via `stdout`
```csv
INT_COLUMN,STRING_COLUMN,DATE_COLUMN,ENUM_COLUMN
4,dog,2020-12-31,V1
,cat,,V2
,weasel,,V1
```
and write a JSON log file indicating which data has been lost during the cleaning process
```json
{
	"total_rows": 3,
	"columns_with_errors": [
		{
			"column_name": "DATE_COLUMN",
			"invalid_row_count": 2,
			"max_illegal_val": "not_a_date",
			"min_illegal_val": "a_date"
		},{
			"column_name": "INT_COLUMN",
			"invalid_row_count": 2,
			"max_illegal_val": "not_an_int",
			"min_illegal_val": "an_int"
		},{
			"column_name": "STRING_COLUMN",
			"invalid_row_count": 0,
			"max_illegal_val": "",
			"min_illegal_val": ""
		},{
			"column_name": "ENUM_COLUMN",
			"invalid_row_count": 1,
			"max_illegal_val": "V5",
			"min_illegal_val": "V5"
		}
	]
}
```

## Limitations

- This tool has end-to-end test coverage, but is still in early alpha development and should not be considered production-ready. PR-requests to make improvements, add missing functionality or fix bugs are all very welcome; as is opening of GitHub issues to request changes or fixes.
- Only supports UTF-8-encoded input data (consider using [`iconv`](https://linux.die.net/man/1/iconv) or similar tools to convert non-UTF-8 data to the required encoding as part of a pipeline)
- Row output order will generally not match row output order, due to individual rows being processed separately across multiple threads.
- Uses empty string values as NULLs across all column types (meaning that other recognised NULL values - such as `<NA>` and `null` - will be converted to empty strings in output, and that all empty string values will be treated as NULL)


## Schema Definition

The type schema must be a JSON file, of the form:
```json
{
    "columns": [
        {
            "name": "INT_COLUMN",
            "column_type": "Int", 
        },
        {
            "name": "STRING_COLUMN",
            "column_type": "String",
            "nullable": false
        },
        {
            "name": "DATE_COLUMN",
            "column_type": "Date",
            "format": "%Y-%m-%d"
        },
        {
            "name": "ENUM_COLUMN",
            "column_type": "Enum",
            "nullable": false,
            "legal_vals": ["V1", "V2", "V3"],
            "illegal_val_replacement": "V1"
        }
    ]
}
```

Column attribute explanation:
* "name": required - must correspond with name of column in CSV file
* "column_type": required - must be one of "String", "Int", "Date", "Float", "Enum" or "Bool"
* "nullable": optional - default value is `true`
* "legal_vals": required for Enum type columns - list of accepted string values
* "illegal_val_replacement": optional for Enum type columns, default replacement is empty sting
* "format": required for Date type columns - 

## Null handling

* The following list of values in the input CSV file are interpretted as `NULL`s by the tool: `["", "#N/A","#N/A N/A","#NA","-1.#IND","-1.#QNAN","-NaN","-nan","1.#IND","1.#QNAN","<NA>","N/A","NA","NULL","NaN","n/a","nan","null"]`
